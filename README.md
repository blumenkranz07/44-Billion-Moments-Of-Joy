# **44 Billion Moments of Joy**

**A real-time Fluxus score generator for Apple Vision Pro**

## 🎭 **Project Overview**
This project reimagines the Fluxus art movement through modern technology, using **Apple Vision Pro** to generate and display **Fluxus scores** in real time.

A **Fluxus score** is a brief instruction meant to be interpreted and carried out by an artist, resulting in an impromptu performance. These performances highlight that creativity is not limited to museums or fine art—it can emerge **anywhere, anytime**, inviting reflection through play.

With **AI-driven object detection and language models**, this system observes the user's environment through the Vision Pro camera and generates a **new Fluxus score**, inspired by historical examples from the famous Fluxus book.

## 🔍 **How It Works**
1. **Object Detection**: The system detects objects in the user's surroundings using **FastViT**.
2. **Fluxus Score Generation**: A **large language model (LLM)** generates poetic, open-ended instructions based on the detected objects.
3. **Score Interpretation**: The generated score is displayed inside the headset as a **printer/POS machine animation**, mimicking the act of receiving an artistic instruction.
4. **Performance & Sharing**: The player can choose to **perform** the score and **upload their experience**, creating a living archive of spontaneous artistic moments.

## 🚀 **Technology Stack**
- **Apple Vision Pro** – Captures real-time environmental input.
- **FastViT** – Performs object detection on the camera feed.
- **LLaMA** – Generates new Fluxus scores based on detected objects.
- **LangChain** – Manages the AI-driven pipeline.
- **ARKit** – Displays scores within the Vision Pro interface.
